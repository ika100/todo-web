This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project

**todo-web** — Web frontend for the todo app

Owned by @ika100. Next.js (App Router only), TypeScript, pnpm, Node 24 LTS. Container image: `ghcr.io/ika100/todo-web`.

## Development Environment

This project uses [devbox](https://www.jetify.com/devbox) to manage the dev environment.

```bash
devbox shell        # enter the dev environment
devbox run dev      # next dev on port 3000
devbox run test     # vitest with coverage
devbox run quality  # eslint + tsc --noEmit gate
```

Canonical `devbox run` scripts (configured in `devbox.json`):

| Script | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `install` | `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` |
| `dev` | Next.js dev server |
| `build` | `next build` (standalone output) |
| `test` | `vitest run --coverage` (thresholds: 80% lines/functions) |
| `test-fast` | `vitest run` without coverage |
| `lint` | `eslint .` |
| `lint-fix` | `eslint . --fix` |
| `typecheck` | `tsc --noEmit` |
| `quality` | `lint` then `typecheck` — the gate CI runs |
| `audit` | `pnpm audit --prod --audit-level high` |
| `secrets-scan` | detect-secrets against `.secrets.baseline.json` |
| `security` | `audit` + `secrets-scan` |
| `image-build` | Build local image `todo-web:scan` |
| `image-scan` | trivy against `todo-web:scan` |

**Rule for every agent (human, CI, and AI): never call `pnpm`, `npm`, `npx`, `node`, `next`, `eslint`, `tsc`, `vitest`, `playwright`, `detect-secrets`, or `trivy` directly. Always go through `devbox run <script>` (add a missing recipe to `devbox.json` rather than bypassing it).**

## Claude Code agents

Agents and slash commands come from the [`ika100/sdlc-foundry`](https://github.com/ika100/sdlc-foundry) marketplace, enabled in `.claude/settings.json`:

- `web@sdlc-foundry` — web coder, tester, deployment, observability, release agents
- `svc@sdlc-foundry` — orchestrators (`/svc:*`), product-manager, architect
- `shared@sdlc-foundry` — quality, security, `/shared:check-quality`, `/shared:new-service`

### Common workflows

| Task | Command |
|---|---|
| Write a feature spec (first step) | `/svc:spec <description>` |
| Plan the approved spec | `/svc:plan <NNN>` |
| Build it: tests first, verified | `/svc:build <NNN>` |
| Where specs stand | `/svc:specs` |
| Small change | `/svc:quick-task <description>` |
| Fix a bug | `/svc:fix-bug <description or error>` |
| Read-only quality + security audit | `/shared:check-quality` |
| Release | `/svc:release` |

### Spec first

A feature starts with a spec, not code ([ADR-026](https://github.com/ika100/sdlc-foundry/blob/main/docs/adr/026-feature-specs.md)): `/svc:spec <description>` writes `docs/specs/<NNN>-<slug>/spec.md` with acceptance criteria `AC-<NNN>.<n>` and asks you its open questions; approve it (`/svc:spec approve <NNN>`), plan it (`/svc:plan <NNN>`), then build it (`/svc:build <NNN>`): acceptance tests are written from the criteria first and fail, the code makes them pass, a reviewer checks the result against the spec, and the PR lists every criterion. Tests that name a criterion are the spec in code: never weaken them; change the spec instead (`/svc:spec --amend <NNN> <change>`). `/svc:specs` shows where each spec stands; `devbox run spec-check` validates every spec and traces built ones to their tests (also the warn-only `specs` CI workflow). Small changes (`/svc:quick-task`) and bug fixes (`/svc:fix-bug`) need no spec, but stop when they would change a criterion.

## Feature Branch Workflow

Branch prefixes: `feature/`, `fix/`, `chore/`, `docs/`, `refactor/`, `release/`. Slugs: lowercase, hyphens, ≤40 chars. Main is protected; all changes via PR. Required CI checks: `quality`, `test`, `security`, `pr-title`, `docker`. PR titles follow Conventional Commits (`type(scope): description ≤72 chars`).

## Conventions

- **App Router only.** Routes live in `app/`; Pages Router is not supported (ADR-004). Server Components by default; add `"use client"` only where needed.
- **TypeScript strict.** No `any` without a justifying comment; `devbox run typecheck` must be clean.
- **Config:** read exclusively from environment variables (see `docs/env-vars.md`). Never expose secrets through `NEXT_PUBLIC_*`.
- **Probes:** `/api/health` (liveness) and `/api/ready` (readiness) must keep responding.
- **Observability:** `/api/metrics` (Prometheus), OpenTelemetry via `instrumentation.ts` when `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` is set.
- **Tests:** Vitest + Testing Library in `tests/` (`*.test.ts[x]`).
- **Docs:** feature specs in `docs/specs/` (index in `docs/backlog.md`), ADRs in `docs/adr/`.

## Docker image pipeline

CI's `docker` job builds the multi-stage, non-root image on every run and pushes on `main` (`latest`, `sha-<short>`) and on `v*.*.*` tags (semver tags). Registry: `ghcr.io/ika100/todo-web`, authenticated with `GITHUB_TOKEN`.

## Deployment

This repo ships **only a container image**. Kubernetes manifests, environment wiring (e.g. `API_URL`), replicas, resources and exposure belong to the product's `gitops-app` repo (platform ADR-017): register the service with `/gitops:compose add todo-web` (needs the GitHub topic `deployable-service`, set by `/shared:new-service`), then `/gitops:promote todo-web <from> <to>`. Change how the service runs by editing its entry in that repo's `services.yaml`; change the port, probe paths or user in the Dockerfile/app and update the entry to match.
